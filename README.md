## Aim
To study and implement C++ Strings.

## Software

STRINGS:
A string refers to a sequence of characters.The #include in C++ is used to include the standard library's string class, which provides a convenient and powerful way to work with text strings. Strings are essentially arrays of characters. Strings are used to store words and text. They are also used to store data, such as numbers and other types of information. Strings in C++ can also be defined using the std::string class.
