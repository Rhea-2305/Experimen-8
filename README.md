# Experiment-8
## Aim
To study and implement C++ Strings.

## Software
Visual Studio Code

## Theory
STRINGS:
A string refers to a sequence of characters.The #include in C++ is used to include the standard library's string class, which provides a convenient and powerful way to work with text strings. Strings are essentially arrays of characters. Strings are used to store words and text. They are also used to store data, such as numbers and other types of information. Strings in C++ can also be defined using the std::string class.

## Program 1
## Aim
Take string input from user and print it.

## Software used
Visual Studio Code

## Output

## Conclusion
We learned how to take string input from user and display it.


## Program 2
## Aim
Take two strings from user and concatenate those.

## Software used
Visual Studio Code

## Theory
String concatenation is the process of joining two or more strings together to form a single string. In C++, the + operator or the append() function can be used to concatenate strings.

## Output

## Conclusion
We learned how to concatenate a string.

## Program 3
## Aim
Take a string from user and reverse it.

## Software used
Visual Studio Code

## Theory
Reversing a string involves rearranging the characters in the string so that they appear in the reverse order.

## Output

## Conclusion
We learned how to reverse a string.

Program 4
Aim:
Check whether the string entered by the user is palindrome

Software used:
Visual Studio Code

Theory:
A string is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. It involves comparing characters from the beginning and end of the string and moving toward the center.
